# Case study Sunspots

# Objective

This project belongs to [kaggle's competitions](https://www.kaggle.com/robervalt/sunspots) and I carried out as a part of a specialization called [DeepLearning.AI TensorFlow Developer Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/specialization/certificate/L6R6AFWVXHZT) which is given by DeepLearning.AI. This specialization is conformed by 4 courses: 
1. Introduction to TensorFlow for Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning 
2. Convolutional Neural Networks in TensorFlow 
3. Natural Language Processing in TensorFlow 
4. Sequences, Time Series and Prediction
Specifically this project is part of the second course in this specialization. 

Sunspots are temporary phenomena on the Sun's photosphere that appear as spots darker than the surrounding areas. They are regions of reduced surface temperature caused by concentrations of magnetic field flux that inhibit convection. Sunspots usually appear in pairs of opposite magnetic polarity. Their number varies according to the approximately 11-year solar cycle. We have a dataset that contains the monthly mean total sunspot number, from 1749/01/01 to 2017/08/31. The idea is to create a Deep Learning model that is capable of predicting the total sunspot number in the future.
